<h1>Storage</h1>
<p>Storage devices in computer systems are the components that <a href="/storage/binary" use:link>storage/binary</a> data is stored on and retrieved from. Temporary memory including RAM is <a href="/storage/primary" use:link>primary</a> storage, while permanent memory where files are saved for long-term use is <a href="/storage/secondary" use:link>secondary</a> storage.</p>
<p>There are <strong>three</strong> main categories of storage devices in a computer: <a href="/storage/magnetic" use:link>magnetic</a>, <a href="/storage/optical" use:link>optical</a> and [[solid state storage]].</p>
