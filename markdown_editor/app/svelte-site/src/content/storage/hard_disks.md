<h1>Magnetic hard disks</h1>
<p>Hard disks magnetically charge sectors of rotating platters to store [[storage/binary]] data. They are [[secondary]] [[storage]] devices that are commonly found in desktop and laptop computers because of their <strong>low cost per gigabyte</strong> and <strong>high capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Hard drive capacities have expanded in recent years due tosectors on drives being made smaller, and by more platters being included inside the drive itself.

Data is read from the platters by a <strong>read/write head</strong> that is so close to the platter that a single piece of dust could damage it, so the enclosures are sealed to prevent damage.</p>
<p>Hard disks are <strong>slower</strong> than [[solid state]] forms of storage because of the moving parts inside the enclosure.</p>
