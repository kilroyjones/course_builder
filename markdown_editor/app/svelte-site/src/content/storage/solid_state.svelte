<h1>Solid state</h1>
<hr />
<p>In solid state <a href="/storage/home" use:link>storage/home</a> devices, <a href="/storage/binary" use:link>storage/binary</a> data is stored with the presence or absence of an electrical charge, meaning there are no moving parts as there are in other storage devices.</p>
<hr />
<p>As a result, solid state devices are  <strong>much faster</strong> and <strong>more robust</strong> than their <a href="/storage/magnetic" use:link>magnetic</a> counterparts, and are generally <strong>more expensive</strong>.</p>
