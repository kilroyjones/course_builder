<h1>Magnetic hard disks</h1>
<p>Hard disks magnetically charge sectors of rotating platters to store <a href="/storage/binary" use:link>storage/binary</a> data. They are <a href="/storage/secondary" use:link>secondary</a> <a href="/storage/home" use:link>storage/home</a> devices that are commonly found in desktop and laptop computers because of their <strong>low cost per gigabyte</strong> and <strong>high capacity</strong>.</p>
<p>Hard drive capacities have expanded in recent years due tosectors on drives being made smaller, and by more platters being included inside the drive itself.
<br><center><img src="static/assets/readwritehead.png"class="img-fluid"></center><br>
Data is read from the platters by a <strong>read/write head</strong> that is so close to the platter that a single piece of dust could damage it, so the enclosures are sealed to prevent damage.</p>
<p>Hard disks are <strong>slower</strong> than <a href="/storage/solid_state" use:link>solid state</a> forms of storage because of the moving parts inside the enclosure.</p>
