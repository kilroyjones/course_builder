Storage devices in computer systems are the components that [[binary]] data is stored on and retrieved from. Temporary memory including RAM is [[primary]] storage, while permanent memory where files are saved for long-term use is [[secondary]] storage.

There are **three** main categories of storage devices in a computer: [[magnetic]], [[optical]] and [[solid state storage]].
