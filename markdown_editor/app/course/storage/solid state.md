# Solid state

---

In solid state [[storage/home]] devices, [[storage/binary]] data is stored with the presence or absence of an electrical charge, meaning there are no moving parts as there are in other storage devices.

As a result, solid state devices are  **much faster** and **more robust** than their [[magnetic]] counterparts, and are generally **more expensive**.
